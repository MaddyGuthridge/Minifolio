Ensemble Forum is an education-centred web forum designed to streamline the
process of getting from question to answer for teachers and students alike. It
was my capstone project for
[UNSW's COMP3900 course](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2022/COMP3900/?year=2022),
where I worked in a team of five students as the lead backend developer. In
this role, I was responsible for the overall design and structure of the
backend, as well as for selecting and enforcing code quality requirements,
including the following:

* 99% code coverage from tests
* Fully type-safe code
* API documentation built from request helper functions
