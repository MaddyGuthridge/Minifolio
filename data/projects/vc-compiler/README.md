VC is a compiler written in Java that converts a C-like language into Jasmin
assembly. This was a university assignment I completed for UNSW's
[Programming Languages and Compilers](https://www.handbook.unsw.edu.au/undergraduate/courses/2022/COMP3131/?year=2022)
course. Although the project framework and some utility code was provided as
starter code, the scanner, parser, checker and emitter were all programmed by
me.
