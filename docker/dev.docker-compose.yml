# Minifolio -- dev.docker-compose.yml
# ===================================
#
# This file defines a docker-compose image suitable for development.
#
# Data paths
# ----------
# * The data directory will be set up inside `./data` on the host system
# * The private_data directory will be set up inside `./private_data` on the
#   host system.
#
# Importantly, you will need to manually create these directories yourself as
# Docker will create them as the root user, making them un-writable for the
# `node` user under which the server runs.
#
# Running:
# --------
# From the root of the repository, run:
#
#     docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml up --build
#
# Testing:
# --------
#
# If you really want to, you might be able to use this to do development
# without actually installing the things you need to work on Minifolio (node,
# etc). You probably shouldn't though.
#
# Note: test suite is currently broken under docker due to inability to remove
# data dir.
#
# Run test suite:
#     docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml exec minifolio npm t
#
# Run type-checking:
#     docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml exec minifolio npm run check
#
# Run linting:
#     docker compose -f docker/dev.docker-compose.yml exec minifolio npm run lint
#
