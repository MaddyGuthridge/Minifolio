# Minifolio -- production.docker-compose.yml
# ==========================================
#
# Example docker-compose.yml for production
#
# Data paths
# ----------
#
# * The data directory will be set up inside `./data` on the host system
# * The private_data directory will be set up inside `./private_data` on the
#   host system.
#
# Importantly, you will need to manually create these directories yourself as
# Docker will create them as the root user, making them un-writable for the
# `node` user under which the server runs.
#
# Note that you may need to adjust these paths if you copy this file out from
# this repo, since it is written so it works nicely when located inside of the
# `docker/` directory.
#
# Running:
# --------
#
# From the root of the repository, run:
#
#     docker compose -f docker/production.docker-compose.yml up
